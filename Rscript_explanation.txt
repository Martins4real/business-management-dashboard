R Script Explanation - business_analytics.R


This script connects to the BusinessManagementDB SQL Server database and generates business insight visualizations.

It uses:
- `DBI` + `odbc` to connect to the database
- `dplyr` for data manipulation
- `ggplot2` for plotting
- `lubridate` for date handling (optional)

What Each Section Does:

1. Total Revenue by State:
   - Groups sales by customer state
   - Displays a bar chart of total revenue per state
   - Helps identify strong or weak sales regions

2. Monthly Revenue Trend:
   - Aggregates total revenue per month (formatted as YYYY-MM)
   - Line plot shows how sales change over time
   - Helps spot seasonal trends or growth spikes

3. Top Vendors by Revenue:
   - Joins Vendors and Sales tables
   - Ranks vendors by total revenue
   - Bar chart makes it easy to compare vendor performance

4. Scatter Plot - Customer Balance vs Sale Amount:
   - Joins CustomerAccounts and Sales
   - Plots customer balance on the X-axis and sale total on the Y-axis
   - Useful for analyzing spending behavior vs. account debt

5. Underperforming States:
   - Flags any states with less than $500 in revenue
   - Text-only output that can guide business recommendations

How to Use:
- Open the script in RStudio
- Run one section at a time to explore specific plots
- Use the "Plots" tab in RStudio to view/flip between graphs
