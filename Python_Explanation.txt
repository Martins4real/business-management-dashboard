This Python script creates a desktop app using Tkinter. It connects to the BusinessManagementDB and allows you to:

1. View Tables
   - Vendors: Shows names and locations
   - Customers: Shows customer contact info
   - Sales: Shows sale dates and totals
   - Invoices: Lists unpaid or paid invoice totals

2. Add Records
   - Customers: Add a new customer by name, address, state
   - Sales: Add a sale by linking a customer, vendor, and employee
   - Invoices: Add new invoice entries with vendor and amount

3. Uses:
   - pyodbc to connect to SQL Server
   - tkinter for GUI layout
   - simpledialog to collect user input
   - messagebox for popups and errors

This app proves you can build real user interfaces that connect to live databases and perform inserts, views, and error handling.
